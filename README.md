# Overview
**SlideshowEx** is an advanced Slideshow widget for [Yootheme Widgetkit2](https://yootheme.com/widgetkit). After installation it becomes available in the Widgets list as a "native" widget and can be used as any other widget.

## Features
### Basic Features

* **Transition effects** - various transition effects, navigations and animation.
* **Display content on top** - you can display content on top of the slides in an overlay.
* **Backward compatibility** - all other behavior, styling and features of the original [Slideshow widget](http://yootheme.com/demo/widgetkit/joomla/index.php/home/slideshow) are preserved.

# Supported platforms

Widget should work with Wordpress 4.4.x (according to feedback from users; I can't test it personally, because I don't have the required subscription).
